In this code, the private key is read from a file instead of being hardcoded in the source code. This is a good security practice as it reduces the risk of the private key being leaked. The private key file should be stored in a secure location and protected with appropriate permissions and encryption.

This code also uses client.transferWithSignature instead of client.transfer, which allows you to sign the transaction with your private key before sending it to the Solana network. This ensures that only you have control over the funds in the account associated with the private key.

Keep in mind that this code is still just a simple example and does not take into account important considerations such as error handling and further security measures. Before using this code on the mainnet, you should thoroughly test it and make sure it meets your requirements and security standards.

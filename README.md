In this code, the private key is read from a file instead of being hardcoded in the source code. The private key file should be stored in a secure location and protected with appropriate permissions and encryption.

This code also uses client.transferWithSignature instead of client.transfer, which allows you to sign the transaction with your private key before sending it to the Solana network. This ensures that only you have control over the funds in the account associated with the private key.

Keep in mind that this code is still just a simple example and does not take into account important considerations such as error handling and further security measures. Before using this code on the mainnet, you should thoroughly test it and make sure it meets your requirements and security standards.


(Adding this code to CRM-in-Rails)

To add this code to the CRM-in-Rails, you would need to integrate the Solana blockchain functionality into your CRM application. Here are the general steps to do this:

Create a new file in your CRM-in-Rails to store the Solana functionality, for example solana.js.

Copy Solana-Send.js code into this new file.

In your CRM-in-Rails code, import the Solana-Send.js file where you need to use the Solana functionality, for example in the customers controller or model.

Call the checkBalance() and sendTransaction() functions as needed in your CRM-in-Rails code.

Note that this code assumes that you have a secure location to store private keys, and that you have a Solana node running and accessible. You will also need to install the @solana/web3.js library by running npm install @solana/web3.js in your CRM application directory.
